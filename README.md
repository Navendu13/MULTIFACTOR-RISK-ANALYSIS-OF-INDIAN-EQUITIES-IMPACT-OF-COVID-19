# 🏥 Healthcare Sector Risk Analysis (FRM Project)

This project analyzes the market risk of selected healthcare stocks using various quantitative risk models. Implemented as part of a Financial Risk Management (FRM) course, the study applies industry-standard techniques to evaluate tail risks and stress scenarios in a post-COVID market environment.

## 📊 Techniques Used
- Historical Value at Risk (VaR)
- Parametric VaR
- Monte Carlo VaR with Normal and t-distributions
- Conditional VaR (CVaR / Expected Shortfall)
- Scenario Analysis with custom stress events

## 📁 File
- `Healthcare_FRM_Final_Project_Code.ipynb`: Full implementation and visualization of all risk measures.

## 🚀 How to Run
1. Open the notebook in JupyterLab or Google Colab
2. Install libraries: `pandas`, `numpy`, `matplotlib`, `scipy`
3. Run cells to simulate and evaluate risk across different methods

## 🧠 Objectives
- Compare effectiveness of different VaR models
- Quantify tail risks for healthcare equities
